# Learning-Machine-Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning Path from Scratch repository! This repository documents my journey of learning machine learning from the basics to advanced topics, including AI, machine learning, and deep learning.

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and notes for my learning path in machine learning. Each folder is dedicated to different topics and projects that I have covered along the way. The goal is to have a comprehensive collection of projects and resources that showcase my learning progress.

## Python Code Samples and Descriptions
### Vectors, Matrices, and Arrays
**Filename:** `LML_1.ipynb`
- **Description:** This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates fundamental NumPy operations. It includes creating and manipulating vectors and matrices, converting matrices to sparse formats, performing element-wise operations, and reshaping arrays. It also covers matrix properties like rank and determinant, along with generating random values and calculating eigenvalues. This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of basic NumPy functionality for data manipulation and analysis.


## Projects
Stay tuned! Projects and code will be added as I learn and progress.
